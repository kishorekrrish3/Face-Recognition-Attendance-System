# Face Recognition Attendance System using Python and OpenCV 📸💻

Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System project! This project utilizes Python, OpenCV, dlib, os, datetime, and numpy modules to create a robust attendance system based on facial recognition.

## Features 🚀

- **Face Recognition:** Utilizes the `face_recognition` library for accurate face recognition.
- **OpenCV Integration:** Leverages the power of `cv2` for image processing and video capture.
- **dlib for Facial Landmarks:** Employs the `dlib` library for detecting facial landmarks to enhance recognition accuracy.
- **Date and Time Tracking:** Records attendance along with date and time using the `datetime` module.
- **OS Module for File Handling:** Efficiently manages file operations using the `os` module.
- **Numpy for Array Operations:** Enhances numerical operations and array handling with the `numpy` module.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- dlib
- numpy
- cmake

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition dlib numpy cmake
```
